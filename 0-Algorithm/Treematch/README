TreeMatch is an algorithm allowing to map processes on cores while reducing
communication cost

Install 
=======

Read ./INSTALL file or:
> ./configure
> sudo make install

Will compile the 'mapping' executable and the libtreematch library

If configure does not exsist run autogen.sh

Install with Scotch
===================

If you want to compile TreeMatch with Scotch features, set the SCOTCH_DIR variable.

> ./configure SCOTCH_DIR=/dir/to/scotch/install
> sudo make install


Dependencies
============

TreeMatch requires HWLOC: http://www.open-mpi.org/projects/hwloc/


Documentation
=============

In ./doc/treematch_doc.txt

It explains how the mapping executable works and the libtreematch API.


Test
====

run ./test_tm.pl in ./examples: (cd examples; ./test_tm.pl)

or do

> make check

Examples
========

Topologies, communication patterns and binding constraints files can be found in ./examples


Source
